                This video gave me a solid walkthrough of responsive design
                basics—media queries, flexible layouts, and how to make a site
                work well across all screen sizes. It was super helpful to see
                how to actually apply what I'm learning right now about
                mobile-first design.

                I found this tutorial really useful for understanding how to use
                CSS variables. It covers how to define reusable values in the
                :root, how to apply them across a stylesheet, and even how they
                help with theming and responsive spacing. Definitely helped me
                clean up my CSS.

                This quick Emmet crash course showed me how to write HTML way
                faster using shorthand. I’m already using Emmet in VS Code, but
                this helped me unlock some of the tricks I didn’t know—like how
                to build navbars or forms in just a few keystrokes.
